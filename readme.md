# Cmdparse

Rust module to help parse command line options.

The parsing should accept most of the stuff you
would expect it to, like using '=' between an option
and its value or the possibility to group short options.
If not you can file an issue or a PR.

## Build

Build with rustpkg :
```
rustpkg buil cmdparse
```

## Doc

The documentation is inline. Generate with
```
rustdoc lib.rs
```
You can see examples in test.rs
